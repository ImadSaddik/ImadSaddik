# About me

I am Imad Saddik, I've found my passion at the intersection of electrical engineering, programming, and astronomy. My journey began in electrical engineering, where I spent five years exploring everything about that field.

While I haven't formally studied astronomy at a university, it's been a lifelong fascination. From a young age, I've pursued this interest independently, driven by curiosity and wonder. Now, as I look to the future, I'm particularly excited about the potential of AI in advancing our understanding of the universe and aiding space exploration.

I believe that developing AI applications for space exploration is fascinating and also important for pushing the boundaries of human knowledge. It's in this area where I want to make my mark in the future.

### My Universe Hub

I am an astronomy enthusiast who discovered a passion for the cosmos at 19. Captivated by the stunning images shared by NASA, ESA, CSA, and APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day), I noticed that APOD's website looked a bit outdated. Since I've been learning web development, I decided to create My Universe Hub, a modern, interactive, and visually engaging version of APOD.

The website is built using Vue.js for the frontend and Django with SQLite for the backend After investing over a year of hard work into this project, I'm excited to share it with the world and invite others to explore and contribute.

## Astrophotography

I love astrophotography. I enjoy taking pictures of the night sky with my phone and telescope. This photo of Orion was taken at Bir Tam Tam, Morocco, and it's one of my favorites.
